The Modelica Association

Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")

<https://www.modelica.org/licenses/>

Version: 1.1.1\
Change date: January 12, 2020

To clarify the intellectual property license granted with respect to
Contributions, as further defined, from any person or entity, all
Modelica Association Projects must have a Contributor License Agreement
(CLA) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating
agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your
protection as a contributor as well as for the protection of the
Modelica Association Projects, and for the Modelica Association as
publisher of its standards and specifications (“Modelica Standards and
Specifications”), library and other Source Code (the “Libraries and
Source Code”), documentation and supporting documents (the
“Documentation”), and for the protection of its users; it does not
change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

This CLA allows an entity (the "Corporation") or an individual
contributor to any Modelica Association project to submit Contributions
to any project organized under the stewardship of the Modelica
Association, and to authorize Contributions submitted by designated
employees of the Corporation or individuals to the Project, and to grant
copyright and patent licenses thereto.

In order to avoid any conflict of interest situation, the Modelica
Association will require from contributors that are employed with a
Corporation that generates revenue from Modelica technology to make
contributions as employees of that Corporation only and not as
individual contributors.

Please complete and sign, then scan and email a pdf file of this
Agreement to backoffice@modelica.org and send the original signed
Agreement to the Modelica Association Backoffice, see https://modelica.org/association.html for the address.

identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or
other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents,
trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware,
and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a
third-party: \[named here\]".

Modelica Association and/or one or several of the other contributors
and/or against members of the MA Project out of, resulting from or in
any way relating to the Work nothing herein shall prevent the Modelica
Association, said contributor and/or member respectively from claiming

party claim is based on Your Contribution(s).
